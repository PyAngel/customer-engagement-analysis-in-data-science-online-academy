# Customer Engagement Analysis In Data Science Online Academy
## This repository contains the analysis and development for customer engagement, content, and course evaluation ratings at Data Science Academy.
✏️ _The database is provided by 365datascience.com, and its use is strictly academic_ ✏️

## OBJETIVE
our goal is to gather quantifiable information about the engagement of our customers with our content, 365 datascience is a online platform to education in datascience and financial analisys,
Part of our growth focuses on providing quality in our academic content, which should help our students contribute satisfactorily to their education.

This project aims to answer the following questions: 
- What is the average and total amount of minutes observed by our students?
- What is the quantity per country of active students, and what is the total minutes viewed grouped by countries?
- What is the amount of viewing minutes and the average rating of each course by our students?
- What is the revenue generated by students for each month?


## DATA

Our client gave us one (1) database file. In this file, they have records for all students stored in different tables.
- T1. Course info: This table contains all course titles with their IDs
- T2. Course Rating: This table contains all records that our students provided for each course in the time range from June to October 2022
- T3. Student Info: This table registers all new students and their nationalities
- T4. Student Learning: This table contains all records of time watched for each course. These records include all student interactions from January to October 2022.
- T5. Student Purchases: This table contains all purchases or subscription renewals, including the date, type, and student ID.

## TECNOLOGY

In this project, I use:

- BI tool: Google Looker Studio
- Database: MySQL 8

## INSIGHTS
1. Average user consume 28 minutes per sesion
2. Countries with fewer users consume more (in minutes) per user than other countries with a significant difference in active users (like the USA, IN),This could be due to consumption habits, lifestyle, among other factors.
3. It is noteworthy that in India, being the country with the highest number of active users, they have consumed only around 26 minutes per user on average in ten months. This could raise a concern, as it suggests that the marketing strategy in that country may be attracting customers who are not very interested in using the service. This could potentially lead to a lack of long-term subscriptions from our current customers in India
4. Continuing with the previous premises in this analysis, it is important to highlight that our introductory courses on data and data science, as well as SQL, have the highest accumulated viewing time globally. In contrast, our more advanced courses (such as PyTorch, etc.) have fewer accumulated views. This may occur as a natural trend when individuals enroll in any intermediate-duration course, where progressively fewer people continue as the course advances.
